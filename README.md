BikeHelp
========

An Android app to help cyclists struck with mechanicals while out and about

-  Summer 2012: original idea developed over lunch between Oliver Lockwood & Mudit Matanhelia
-  November 2012: original sketch implementation with some rather hokey Java code

This repo now archived - instead I've been contributing my ideas to the existing [CycleStreets app](https://github.com/cyclestreets/android).
